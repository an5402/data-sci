These instructions pertain to the current release as of May 9, 2020:

1. Pandas and Numpy are dependencies 

2. The docstrings contain all you need to know about valid inputs

3. If your label is a simple transformation of an existing data column, you should drop that column from your input data to the
classifier to avoid a trivial result.

4. Name your label column "lbl" and include it at the end of your data frame (the classifier stops checking features as soon as it hits
a column named "lbl". This will be changed to support easier use later

5. Enjoy!
