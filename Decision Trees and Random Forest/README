These instructions pertain to the current release as of May 10, 2020:

0. Graphs are not yet implemented.

1. Pandas, Numpy, math, and random are dependencies (math and random are included with base Python)

2. The docstrings contain all you need to know about valid inputs

3. If your label is a simple transformation of an existing data column, you should drop that column from your input data to the
classifier to avoid a trivial result. This instruction is more of a suggestion. 

4. Name your label column "lbl" and include it at the end of your data frame (the classifier stops checking features as soon as it hits
a column named "lbl". This will be changed to support easier use later

5. Always use data science for good.
