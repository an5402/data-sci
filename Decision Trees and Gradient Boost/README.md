This folder contains the python code that implements the Gradient Boost regression algorithm.

As of May 18, 2020 the current release is a work in progress. 

IMPLEMENTED:
- Basic Functions
- Basic Decision Tree Node Functionality
- Basic Decision Tree Functionality

TODO:
- Gradient Boost
- Finalize Decision Trees
- Optimize Code
- Test and Validate

If you'd like to test the decision tree code, you will need to create a target column in your input data frame named "tg" for target.
Ideally, this column is not a simple linear combination of the existing columns.
